# IS-Gap

David Hume famously claimed that one cannot deduce _ought_-type statements from _is_-type statements. The present relationship between Science and Society, whether correct or not, often puts the brunt of knowing _is_-type statements on scientists and academics but leaves _ought_-type statements to the general public.

**Science tells us how the world is. Society tells us how we think the world ought to be.**

There's a major problem with this separation, however.

**Society cannot make adequate assessments about how the world ought to be if academic facts are a privilege of the educated.**

## That's where IS-Gap comes in.

_IS-Gap_ aims to make academic material digestible, searchable, and accessible to a broader range of people than exists currently. We hope that by democratizing the summarization of academic articles, users will be able to identify the most understandable and accurate interpretation of academic material for public use.
